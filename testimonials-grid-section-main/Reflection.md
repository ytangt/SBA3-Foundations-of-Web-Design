## Reflection
During this project, controlling the **staggered grid layout** was the biggest challenge. Initially, I tried simple column ratios, but the spacing between cards was not consistent. By using nested rows with varied column widths and combining Bootstrapâ€™s gutter classes (`g-4`) and centering utilities (`mx-auto`), I managed to replicate the visual arrangement accurately.    

If given more time, I would:  
- Add breakpoint-specific column classes (eg `col-lg-8`, `col-md-12`) for better responsiveness.  

This project strengthened my understanding of Bootstrap utilities, nested row structures, and responsive design, and it gave me confidence in handling complex layouts.
